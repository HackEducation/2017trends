<p>I've wrapped up my series "<a href="http://2016trends.hackeducation.com">Top Ed-Tech Trends of 2016</a>," so it's time to start working on 2017. </p>

<p>Ugh. I think. This is a lot of work. Is it worth it?</p>

<p>I plan to keep this blog updated regularly throughout the year. I'll post thoughts as the year progresses on what I'm seeing as emerging trends. I'll also link to all the weekly news summaries and weekly newsletters, so that it's easier to compile the data when I start working on the year-end series in December.</p>
