<p>Last year, I called &#8220;<a href="http://2016trends.hackeducation.com/2016/03/08/procurement">disrupting procurement</a>&#8221; a trend to watch, noting the repeated argument that the reason why the ed-tech industry struggles &#8211; with making money, with making decent products &#8211; is that the market is so difficult to crack; the procurement process is so cumbersome. </p>

<p>When I wrote my year-end review of the &#8220;<a href="http://2016trends.hackeducation.com/">Top Ed-Tech Trends</a>,&#8221; the &#8220;procurement problem&#8221; was subsumed <a href="http://2016trends.hackeducation.com/business.html">under the broader category of &#8220;The Business of Ed-tech.&#8221;</a> Here&#8217;s an excerpt from that article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8230; <a href="http://www.chronicle.com/article/What-s-Really-to-Blame-for/235620">Is procurement really why we have terrible ed-tech</a>?</p>
<br />
<p>For the last couple of years &#8211; at the very least since the resurgence in venture-back ed-tech startups &#8211; there&#8217;s been a steady drumbeat of complaints that the procurement process at both the K–12 and college levels is broken. It&#8217;s inefficient. It&#8217;s &#8220;dysfunctional.&#8221; I&#8217;ve heard the complaint from entrepreneurs. I&#8217;ve heard it from their investors, many of whom argue that the challenges of selling to schools is one of the things that makes education a difficult market to crack (and in turn ed-tech startups a poor investment).</p>
<br />
<p>There&#8217;s a lot that&#8217;s wrong with the process, no doubt. For starters, the <a href="http://edutechnica.com/2016/03/11/lms-rfps-and-blaming-the-system/">hefty RFP requirements</a> almost by design tilt purchasing decisions towards big companies and incumbent players. The folks who make the decisions about what to buy typically aren&#8217;t the people who are using the products in the classroom.</p>
<br />
<p>There&#8217;s not a lot of transparency in the procurement process; nor is it easy to find out afterwards which products schools bought or use – although that&#8217;s not something you hear companies moan about, funnily enough. You&#8217;re just supposed to trust them when they brag they&#8217;re used in <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3065654/innovation-agents/classdojo-is-teaching-kids-empathy-in-90-of-schools-nationwide">90%</a> of schools. (<a href="http://morganpolikoff.com/2016/01/14/an-awful-lot-of-districts-dont-know-what-textbooks-are-used-in-their-schools/">USC professor Morgan Polikoff&#8217;s research</a> on textbook adoption, for example, has made this painfully clear. He&#8217;s sent FOIA requests to school districts, and in many cases they have been unwilling or unable to share their textbook data. And when they do, <a href="http://morganpolikoff.com/2015/11/19/hufflin-muffin-or-the-craziness-of-textbook-data/">the data is often a mess</a>.)</p>
<br />
<p>In the last few years, lots of consulting firms and organizations have offered their <a href="http://www.digitalpromise.org/blog/entry/evolving-technology-procurement-in-schools-with-ideo">suggested solutions</a> for fixing (what they see as) procurement problems. Last year Edsurge <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-06-26-questions-and-answers-about-edsurge-s-concierge-service">launched a “concierge” service</a> in which it said it would <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-05-11-sbir-awards-14-grants-to-edtech-developers-including-edsurge">help schools</a> identify its tech needs and then buy things based on those needs (and then take a cut of the contracts, of course), and it continues to position itself as a <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-11-21-where-to-find-money-for-your-school-s-edtech-purchases">liaison</a> between startups and schools.</p>
<br />
<p>This spring, Harold O. Levy, executive director of the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, <a href="http://hechingerreport.org/a-new-nonprofit-takes-aim-at-ed-tech-pricing-first-target-the-ipad/">launched the Technology for Education Consortium</a> in order to offer &#8220;price transparency&#8221; around procurement. The organization&#8217;s first target was Apple, which it found charged different districts different prices for identical iPads. (<a href="https://marketbrief.edweek.org/marketplace-k-12/new-tech-consortium-to-probe-ed-tech-prices-policies-across-k-12-districts/">Apple disputed the organization&#8217;s assertions</a>.)</p>
<br />
<p>This fall, the <a href="https://marketbrief.edweek.org/marketplace-k-12/k-12-districts-get-price-transparency-broadband-rates-new-tool/">EducationSuperHighway released a price comparison tool</a> so that districts could see neighbors&#8217; broadband costs and ideally leverage that information to get a better deal.</p>
<br />
<p>(All of these organizations &#8211; Edsurge, EducationSuperHighway, the Technology for Education Consortium &#8211; are funded by the Gates Foundation. And the beat goes on.)</p>
<br />
<p>Some schools made efforts to tackle procurements problems too. UNC, for example, launched a Yelp-like review site for ed-tech tools, where, <a href="http://www.chronicle.com/article/UNC-Gives-Professors-a-Way-to/235367">according to The Chronicle of Higher Education</a>, &#8220;it is asking professors to review and comment on how useful various digital services were in their classrooms.&#8221;</p>
<br />
<p>But by and large, procurement issues are a problem identified by companies that companies decide they will &#8220;fix&#8221; in turn: &#8220;Try Before You Buy,&#8221; <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-06-02-try-before-you-buy-clever-s-co-pilot-aims-to-help-schools-pilot-and-purchase">Edsurge reported in June</a>. &#8220;Clever&#8217;s &#8216;Co-Pilot&#8217; Aims to Help Schools Pilot and Purchase.&#8221; Indeed, an <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-11-09-which-edtech-companies-are-producing-the-best-research-based-products">increasingly popular service</a> offered by ed-tech companies and <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Which-Ed-Tech-Tools-Truly/237196">ed-tech investors</a> is &#8220;<a href="https://marketbrief.edweek.org/fundamentals/new-analysis-compares-costs-effectiveness-k-3-math-products/">research</a>&#8221; into <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-10-11-what-to-ask-when-choosing-tech-for-schools">how to buy ed-tech</a> and into <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-07-10-not-sure-what-courseware-to-try-this-tool-wants-to-make-your-decision-easier">which ed-tech products are best</a>, which &#8220;<a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-11-07-what-data-will-show-that-edtech-works">work</a>&#8221; (<a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/08/03/complete-college-america-launches-seal-approval-program-ed-tech-vendors">whatever that means</a>).</p>
<br />
<p>(<a href="http://hackeducation.com/2016/05/03/who-is-funding-this-bs">These companies almost all share the same investors too. And the beat goes on</a>.)</p>
<br />
<p>One of the ways in which ed-tech startups have found success in getting their products widely adopted is to sell to charter schools, particularly charter school chains. (Again, they often share the same investors.) Charter school chains, in turn, have started to license their products and <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-05-26-lindsay-unified-joins-the-growing-number-of-schools-franchising-their-models-to-other-systems">franchise their models</a> to others. As such, it&#8217;s difficult to separate &#8220;<a href="http://www.sltrib.com/news/3863111-155/analysis-utah-charter-schools-move-millions">the business of education technology</a>&#8221; from “the business of charter schools” – and why it&#8217;s difficult, <a href="http://2016trends.hackeducation.com/politics.html">as I noted in the previous article in this series</a>, &#8220;the politics of education technology&#8221; from &#8220;the politics of education reform.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s a lengthy excerpt, I realize, but it helps situate what&#8217;s happened in the first few months of 2017 with regard to this particular &#8220;trend.&#8221; I&#8217;ve already seen indications that more companies believe that &#8220;fixing procurement&#8221; &#8211; that is, <em>selling procurement services to schools</em> &#8211; is a big business opportunity. </p>

<h3>And What Do These Companies Recommend Schools Buy?</h3>
<br />
<p>One of the problems with schools&#8217; procurement processes is that they do lack transparency. As I monitor this &#8220;trend&#8221; this year, I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s worth going through a FOIA process to see what sorts of contracts Edsurge, for example, has signed with districts (and gleaning in turn what kinds of recommendations it is making).</p>

<p>Even if we can&#8217;t know which particular brand of presentation software or learning management system schools are being urged to buy, we can still see the overarching push here based on the rest of ed-tech marketing: all the buzzwords like &#8220;personalization&#8221; and &#8220;mastery.&#8221; And I bet no one hires an an ed-tech company to tell them that, to be perfectly frank, they needn&#8217;t buy any tech at all.</p>
