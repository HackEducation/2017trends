<p>Last year, I called &#8220;<a href="http://2016trends.hackeducation.com/2016/06/03/grit">social-emotional learning</a>&#8221; a trend to watch, noting that companies were seizing on buzzwords like &#8220;grit,&#8221; &#8220;growth mindset,&#8221; and &#8220;resilience&#8221; in order to build technologies that purported to measure and monitor students emotional not just academic development. </p>

<p>&#8220;Social-emotional learning&#8221; didn&#8217;t make the cut of my final list of &#8220;<a href="http://2016trends.hackeducation.com/">Top Ed-Tech Trends</a>,&#8221; although I mentioned as part of <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2016/12/19/top-ed-tech-trends-personalization">a broader look at &quot;personalization</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>(As part of my year-in-review, I also compiled <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com/2016/12/19/character-edu">a list</a> of &#8220;character education&#8221; startups who&#8217;d raised venture capital in 2017. For what it&#8217;s worth, so far <em>this</em> year, I haven&#8217;t seen any software companies in the business of building &#8220;social emotional learning&#8221; products tout investment. And that&#8217;s <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/on_innovation/2017/03/embedding_sel_across_the_curriculum.html">despite investors&#8217; obvious continued interest in</a> and <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-04-20-panorama-s-student-progress-reports-show-more-than-grades-think-behavior-and-sel">promotion</a> of the idea.)</p>

<p>What are the connections between a push to measure and monitor &#8220;social-emotional learning&#8221; (via technology) and a push to &#8220;personalize learning&#8221; (also via technology)? What sorts of surveillance happens in this framework? What sorts of (algorithmic) assessments are made about students&#8217; development? How do we define or imagine &#8220;personalization,&#8221; and how is that influenced by ad-tech and social media (more so than by education theory or history)?</p>

<p>The Australian (paywalled, sorry) has just reported on a leaked document, apparently from Facebook, that reveals the company &#8220;uses algorithms to collect data (via posts, pictures, and reactions) on the emotional state of 6.4 million &#8216;high schoolers,&#8217; &#8216;tertiary students,&#8217; and &#8216;young Australians and New Zealanders â€¦ in the workforce,&#8217; indicating &#8216;moments when young people need a confidence boost.&#8217;&#8221; (That citation comes <a href="http://mashable.com/2017/04/30/facebook-leaked-report-advertising-children/">from Mashable</a>. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/business/2017/05/facebook-helped-advertisers-target-teens-who-feel-worthless/">Ars Technica also has the story</a>, along with a response from Facebook that contends The Australian&#8217;s article is misleading.)</p>

<p>There are certainly echoes here of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/everything-we-know-about-facebooks-secret-mood-manipulation-experiment/373648/">Facebook&#8217;s infamous &#8220;mood manipulation&#8221; experiment</a> back in 2013 (something that prompted <a href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/short-statement-on-massiveteaching-part-i.html">University of Zurich professor Paul-Olivier Dehaye</a>, in turn, to highlight how <a href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/extended-statement-on-massiveteaching-part-ii.html">similar sorts of unethical practices</a> could easily take place in an online learning platform like Coursera).</p>

<p>Behavioral tracking and behavioral modification. Pigeons and personalization.</p>
