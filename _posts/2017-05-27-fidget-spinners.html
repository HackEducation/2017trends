<p>OK, fidget spinners aren&#8217;t really a &#8220;trend to watch.&#8221; I imagine they&#8217;re going to be one of those consumer products that gets a lot of news, generates a flurry of sales, prompts schools to establish all sorts of rules and punishments, and then disappears by the time I write my year-in-review. (Perhaps the equivalent last year was Pokemon Go.) </p>

<p>But I want to jot down links to some of the stories that have been written about this hot little piece of ed-tech (yes, this is ed-tech) because I do think it serves to underscore some of the other trends I see in play: namely, a focus on behavioral management in the classroom and an emphasis on &#8220;<a href="http://2017trends.hackeducation.com/2017/05/01/social-emotional-learning">social emotional learning</a>.&#8221; </p>

<p>Both of these trends, according to education technology and education reform proponents, seem require <em>technological</em> interventions (and, by extension, technology products). By using that word &#8220;intervention,&#8221; I purposefully mean to invoke in its medical definition and implications. Students, in this particular framework, are viewed as though they need to be &#8220;treated&#8221; in order to prevent harm, improve functioning, and so on. </p>
