<p>In the last few years, the &#8220;skills gap&#8221; has been invoked by politicians and pundits alike. It&#8217;s a narrative that gets wielded to justify changes to the structure of both K&#8211;12 and post-secondary education. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve noticed a growing number of startups that say their product/service works to address that gap, not through job <em>training</em> so much as job <em>placement</em>. These include career matching services, human resources software, and the like. (Bonus points if you can boast about &#8220;algorithms&#8221; in your pitch. Here&#8217;s a sample headline: &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/24/headstart-wants-to-better-analyze-candidates-to-fit-them-with-the-best-jobs/">Headstart wants to better analyze candidates to fit them with the best jobs</a>.&#8221; Bonus points for that startup in appropriating the name of a well-known early childhood education program.) </p>

<p>I have added &#8220;The Business of Job Training&#8221; to my Hack Education Weekly News, but we should probably think about this as &#8220;The Business of Jobs&#8221; more generally. This is intertwined, no doubt, with other trends I&#8217;m monitoring: for-profit higher education and credentialing, for example, as well as Trump's efforts to curb immigration and limit visas.</p>
