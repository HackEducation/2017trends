<p>Although publication of my &#8220;Top Ed-Tech Trends&#8221; series happens in December, it&#8217;s truly a year-round project. As we're about halfway through the year, I'm already starting to think about what I'm going to write about in those articles.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve penned a couple of stories so far on &#8220;trends to watch&#8221; &#8211; or rather, short research notes that might help me down the road when I write my year-end analysis:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://2017trends.hackeducation.com/2017/06/23/automated-parenting">Trend to Watch: Automated Parenting</a></li>
<li><a href="http://2017trends.hackeducation.com/2017/06/26/job-placement">Trend to Watch: Job Placement</a></li>
<li><a href="http://2017trends.hackeducation.com/2017/05/27/fidget-spinners">Trend to Watch: Fidget Spinners</a></li>
<li><a href="http://2017trends.hackeducation.com/2017/05/01/social-emotional-learning">Trend to Watch: Social-Emotional Learning (Algorithms)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://2017trends.hackeducation.com/2017/03/04/procurement">Trend to Watch: Ed-Tech Procurement-as-a-Service</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Not all of these (and perhaps none of these) will make it into my &#8220;top ten.&#8221;. Indeed these "trends to watch" are in addition to topics I&#8217;ve covered <a href="http://research.hackeducation.com/trends.html">in previous years</a> that continue to be relevant:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Business of Student Loans</li>
<li>Privacy and Information Security</li>
<li>For-Profit Higher Education</li>
<li>Personalization</li>
<li>Social Media and Campus Free Speech</li>
</ul>

<p>But so far this year, the overarching trend I&#8217;m seeing in ed-tech is &#8220;fake news&#8221; &#8211; that is, calls for better &#8220;digital literacy,&#8221; calls to rethink &#8220;digital literacy,&#8221; and then the completely made-up bullshit appearing regularly in ed-tech companies&#8217; press releases and ed-tech publications&#8217; churnalism.</p>
