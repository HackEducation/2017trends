<p>Even though there are still four months (and change) left in 2017, I&#8217;m fairly certain that I&#8217;ve already identified the &#8220;top ed-tech trends&#8221; I will write about in my annual series. </p>

<p>This will be the eighth year I&#8217;ve undertaken this project, and I know by now that it&#8217;s an immense amount of work. As such, it&#8217;s best to start early. It takes about a month in order to pull together all the news and links from the year and another month to write the ten articles. That&#8217;s pretty goddamn impressive, if you ask me, because I typically write the equivalent of a book in that time frame.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a little nervous about this year&#8217;s project as I start my Spencer Education Journalism Fellowship this week. Initially Kin and I had thought that we&#8217;d keep our apartment in LA and that I&#8217;d return to the west coast for November and December and the intensive research and writing of the year-in-review. But now I&#8217;m not sure. We might get an apartment here in NYC. As everything is so up in the air, it makes this project seem even more daunting, and I think I&#8217;m going to try to start work on it even earlier than usual.</p>

<p>As it stands, here are the trends I&#8217;ve identified:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Politics of Ed-Tech</li>
<li>The Business of Ed-Tech</li>
<li>Fake News</li>
<li>Privacy and Surveillance</li>
<li>Personalization</li>
<li>Automation</li>
<li>CTE (Career and Technical Education) and &#8220;Skills&#8221;</li>
<li>Free Speech &#8211; on Campus, on Social Media</li>
<li>Social Emotional Learning</li>
<li>Inequality</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#8217;d like to talk about platform capitalism too, which I think is intertwined with data, privacy, personalization, and inequality. That&#8217;s the challenge with all of these &#8211; they&#8217;re all connected: the politics and the business; the exploitation and inequality and the surveillance; shutting down free speech and academic freedom and rebranding education as about jobs and skills, and so on.</p>

<p>From this list, I hope to make it clear that I am less interested in particular products or even the things that are usually designated as &#8220;trends.&#8221; I don&#8217;t think VR is a trend. I don&#8217;t think the Internet of Things is a trend. I think those both are a reflection of a technological culture that responds to press releases more than to anything else. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;d say the most important trend so far this year is &#8220;fake news&#8221; and not, say, 3D printing or what have you.</p>
