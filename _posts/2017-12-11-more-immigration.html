<p><em>Even though every article I write in this series is incredibly long, I always have to leave something out.

<h3>Paddington Bear and Immigration</h3>
<br />
<p><a href="https://tinyletter.com/audreywatters/letters/hewn-no-220">From HEWN, No. 220</a>:</p>

<p>The children&#8217;s author Michael Bond passed away this week. As a little girl, I was quite fond of his character Olga da Polga, a much more interesting guinea pig than my pet guinea pig ever was. Whenever I&#8217;d put my guinea pig out in a hutch on the grass in the back yard, he&#8217;d escape and run away; Olga da Polga, on the other hand, sat there munching grass and telling wild stories. </p>

<p>But it was Paddington Bear, of course, that was always my favorite. (On my website, I cite his &#8220;<a href="http://audreywatters.com/">hard stare</a>&#8221; as inspiration for my own.) I haven&#8217;t kept many childhood possessions &#8211; I didn&#8217;t keep <em>The Tales of Olga da Polga</em> &#8211; but I still have all the Paddington Bear books. (If my little brother is reading this, yes, some of these are probably yours. Tough shit. They&#8217;re on my bookshelf now.)</p>

<p>Bond created the character after buying a rather lonely looking teddy bear, so the story goes, and imagining what would happen if an unaccompanied bear turned up at a train station. At the time, Bond lived near Paddington Railway Station, which had been the site from which many London children were evacuated during World War II. Bond said that he had memories of those children with labels around their necks and all their possessions in a suitcase.</p>

<p>And so Bond gave us a bear from Peru, found at Paddington Station by the Brown family, sitting on his suitcase with a note attached to his coat: &#8220;Please look after this bear. Thank you.&#8221; </p>

<p>Paddington was <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/paddington-bear-refugee">a refugee</a>, of sorts. He&#8217;d come all the way to London in a lifeboat, he told the Browns. He insisted hotly that did not make him a criminal. <strong>We should look after refugees, you know. We should take them in and feed them and care for them and protect them from unfriendly, prying neighbors.</strong></p>
