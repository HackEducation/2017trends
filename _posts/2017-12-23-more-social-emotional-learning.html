<p><em>Here are some of the other stories that were told about mindsets and emotions &#8211; stories I didn&#8217;t fit into <a href="http://2017trends.hackeducation.com/social-emotional-learning.html">part ten</a> in my year-end-series:</em></p>

<p>Damn. There is a lot of bullshit attached to that word &#8220;mindset.&#8221; <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-06-25-summer-pd-feel-overwhelming-an-improviser-s-mindset-can-help-you-keep-cool">Improviser mindset</a>.

<p>I would be remiss if I did not mention somewhere one of the most important &#8220;brain-based&#8221; stories of the year: Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy associated with head injuries (and sports). I have given up watching football, my favorite sport, this year. In part, I am boycotting the NFL to stand in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick. But I also just cannot watch any more. I cannot watch the game for fear that I&#8217;ll see someone die on the field. I cannot watch the game because I know that the ramifications of repetitive concussive injuries affect players off the field. <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/20170808/baltimore-ravens-offensive-lineman-john-urschel-retires-abruptly">Baltimore Ravens offensive lineman John Urschel retired abruptly</a> this year, days after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/07/25/sports/football/nfl-cte.html">a medical study was released</a> that found the degenerative CTE in 110 out of 111 brains it examined. (Urschel is also a PhD student at MIT.) After former Patriots and convicted murderer Aaron Hernandez killed himself this spring, his family donated his brain to research. He &#8220;suffered from most severe CTE ever found in a person his age,&#8221; <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/aaron-hernandez-suffered-from-most-severe-cte-ever-found-in-a-person-his-age/2017/11/09/fa7cd204-c57b-11e7-afe9-4f60b5a6c4a0_story.html">The Washington Post reported</a>.</p>

<p>Who&#8217;s brains really matter with all this interest in &#8220;brain-based education&#8221;? Whose brains. Whose bodies. Whose futures.</p>
