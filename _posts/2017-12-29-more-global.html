<p>Each year that I write this review, someone inevitably complains that I&#8217;ve focused too exclusively on what&#8217;s happening in the US. After writing some 75,000 words over the course of six or so weeks, I&#8217;m usually on my last nerve and want to reply &#8220;You are welcome to write about what happened in your country, and I will gladly link to it.&#8221; My emphasis on the politics and business of ed-tech in the US is not meant to imply that what happens here necessarily echoes elsewhere. It&#8217;s worth thinking about how policies and technologies do spread from the US to other countries and how and when they do not. </p>

<p>There&#8217;s a strong imperialist bent to US technology firms. And that dovetails so neatly with the long history of imperialism and education. It&#8217;s something to watch for. It&#8217;s something I didn&#8217;t really explore this year in depth in this series, but observed when it comes to private school startups (Bridge International Academies and the like) as well as coding bootcamps (Andela, for example.)</p>

<p>Here are some other stories about education technology (and academic freedom) that I noted this year, but couldn&#8217;t squeeze into my year-in-review:</p>
