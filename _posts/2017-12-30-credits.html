<p>This end-of-year series would not be possible without the work of a lot of folks whose writing and thinking shapes and influences my own. This year&#8217;s project owes a particular debt to Tressie McMillan Cottom, Chris Gilliard, Mike Caulfield, Ben Williamson, Michael Sacasas, Nick Srnicek, Frank Pasquale, Jane Meyer, Doug Levin, and Benjamin Doxtdator. My work builds on scholarship, theory, and analysis, but it draws heavily on the day-to-day reporting of many education journalists. So a nod to some of those I most often cite: Ben Herold, Natasha Singer, Molly Hensley-Clancy, Matt Barnum, and Jennifer Berkshire.</p>

<p><a href="http://hackeducation.com/support/">Thank you to everyone who donates to Hack Education</a>. I really could not do this work without the financial support of readers. And thank you to those institutions and organizations that invited me to speak this year: that&#8217;s the money that also helps make ends meet, sure, but it&#8217;s also a great opportunity to bounce my ideas off of living bodies, not just a flashing cursor.</p>

<p>And a special thanks to Kin who tolerates me every month of the year but particularly during November and December when I am at my most manic.</p>
