<p><em>Here are some of the other stories that were told about the business of education technology &#8211; stories I didn&#8217;t fit into <a href="http://2017trends.hackeducation.com/business.html">part eleven</a> in my year-end-series:</em></p>

<p>How markets get identified: &#8220;Why Edtech Executives Are Keeping a Close Eye on Preschool Demographics,&#8221; <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-10-02-why-edtech-executives-are-keeping-a-close-eye-on-preschool-demographics">via Edsurge</a>. Pay attention in the coming years to how executives and investors (and of course Edsurge) talk about English-language learning.</p>

<p>Sometimes I want to bust open the category of ed-tech, just to remind people it&#8217;s not all shiny apps and gadgetry. Take, for example, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2017/07/05/smartphones-blamed-dramatic-rise-inheadlice-schoolchildren-gather/">the business of head lice</a>. <a href="http://www.nola.com/education/index.ssf/2017/11/bulletproof_panels_backpacks_f.html">The business of bulletproofing schools</a>.</p>

<p>What didn&#8217;t I write about in this series? The business of OER. The business of testing. The business of textbooks. Sorry. (Not sorry.)</p>
