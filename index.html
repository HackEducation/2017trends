<p>2017 will be the eighth year in which I've reviewed the most important trends in the ed-tech industry from the previous twelve months. (You can look at the trends I identified from previous years <a href="http://research.hackeducation.com/trends.html">here</a>.)</p>

<p>This project has a blog where you can <a href="http://2017trends.hackeducation.com/blog">follow along as I gather my thoughts</a> on the top "trends" in ed-tech. You can also read more about the investments that fuel these "trends" at <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com">funding.hackeducation.com</a>.</p>
