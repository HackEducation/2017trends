<p>2017 marks the eighth year in which I&#8217;ve reviewed the most important stories in the ed-tech industry from the previous twelve months. (You can look at the topics I identified in previous years <a href="http://research.hackeducation.com/trends.html">here</a>.)</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://2017trends.hackeducation.com/fake-news.html">Education Technology and Fake News</a></li>
<li><a href="http://2017trends.hackeducation.com/betsy-devos.html">Education Technology, Betsy DeVos, and the Innovation Gospel</a></li>
<li><a href="http://2017trends.hackeducation.com/student-loans.html">Education Technology and the Business of Student Debt</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This project includes <a href="http://2017trends.hackeducation.com/blog">a blog</a> where you can read supplemental stories about how I work and about my thoughts throughout the year on these (and other) &#8220;trends.&#8221; You can also read more about the investments and investors that fuel these powerful education stories at <a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com">funding.hackeducation.com</a>.</p>
